I am a postdoc in the [Department of Mathematics](https://www.ma.utexas.edu/) at the University of Texas, Austin (UTAUS) under the supervision of Professor [Thomas Chen](https://web.ma.utexas.edu/users/tc/) and Professor [Natasa Pavlovic](https://web.ma.utexas.edu/users/natasa/). I study perturbed mean-field dynamics of many-body quantum system (both Bosonic and Fermionic systems). My Ph.D. advisors were Professor [Manoussos Grillakis](http://www.math.umd.edu/~mggrlk/) and Professor [Matei Machedon](http://math.umd.edu/~matei/).
