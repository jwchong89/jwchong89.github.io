I am both a TAL instructor and a Boya postdoctoral fellow in the [School of Mathematical Sciences](http://english.math.pku.edu.cn/) at Peking University under the supervision of Professor [Zhang Zhifei](http://english.math.pku.edu.cn/peoplefaculty/128.html). I study perturbed mean-field dynamics of many-body quantum system (both Bosonic and Fermionic systems). My Ph.D. advisors were Professor [Manoussos Grillakis](http://www.math.umd.edu/~mggrlk/) and Professor [Matei Machedon](http://math.umd.edu/~matei/).
